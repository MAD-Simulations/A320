# A320
This is the repository for the A320 for X-Plane 12.

To download click the green code button and click Download as ZIP. Unpack the ZIP file in your X-Plane Aircraft directory and start X-Plane to fly.

This A320 comes with 8 liveries, Avitab tablet and you can change the liveries from the tablet inside the cockpit.
The Exterior and interior come from Flightgear, instrument screens from Laminar. Most buttons already work, all exterior animations work and the aircraft has XP12 exterior lightning.
Interior lightning has to be included in a upcoming version. The knobs for the interior lightning are not yet usable.
This is the first version of the aircraft so there might still be bugs. Please let me know if you find any.


**Original version Flightgear:**
It's a fork of the A320 from Flightgear. You can find the Flightgear A320 at: https://github.com/legoboyvdlp/A320-family
You can find more liveries at: https://github.com/legoboyvdlp/A320-family-liveries/tree/master 
I encourage everyone to also try the Flightgear A320, they have a very good system simulation and sounds. 
The aouthors of the X-Plane version are in the Thanks.md file. Please show them some respect.
